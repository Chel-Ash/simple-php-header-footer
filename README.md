# simple-php-header-footer
A simple header.php and footer.php so you don't have to include it on every PHP page you make.

## Setup
Just download/copy & paste all the files in this repository into your web server. That's it!

You can modify the `header.php` and `footer.php` files and they'll take effect onto the `index.php` file, you can then simply add the content of your homepage onto the `index.php` file.

Rinse and repeat the process for multiple pages. Include these pieces of code on any custom page. Add this at the top of your page:
```php
<?php
include 'header.php;
?>
```
and this at the bottom:
```php
<?php
include 'footer.php;
?>
```
